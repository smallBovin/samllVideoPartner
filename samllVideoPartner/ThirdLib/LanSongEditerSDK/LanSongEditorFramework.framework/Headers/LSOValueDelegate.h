/*!
 @brief LSOValueDelegate is not intended to be used directly. It is used for type safety.
 @discussion LSOValueDelegates are used to dynamically change animation data at runtime. A delegate is set for a keypath, defined by LSOKeypath. While the animation is running the delegate is asked for the value for the keypath at each frame of the animation. The delegate is given the computed animation value for the the current frame. See LSOKeypath and the setValueDelegate:forKeypath methond on LSOAnimationView.

 Prebuild delegates can be found in LSOBlockCallback, LSOInterpolatorCallback, and LSOValueCallback. These delegates allow direct setting and driving of an animated value.
 See LSOColorValueDelegate, LSONumberValueDelegate, LSOPointValueDelegate, LSOSizeValueDelegate, LSOPathValueDelegate.
