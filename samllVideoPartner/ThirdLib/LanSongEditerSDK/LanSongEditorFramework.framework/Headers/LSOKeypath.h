/*!
 @brief LSOKeypath is an object that describes a keypath search for nodes in the animation JSON. LSOKeypath matches views inside of LSOAnimationView to their After Effects counterparts.

 @discussion
 LSOKeypath is used with LSOAnimationView to set animation properties dynamically at runtime, to add or mask subviews, converting geometry, and numerous other functions.

 LSOKeypath can describe a specific object, or can use wildcards for fuzzy matching of objects. Acceptable wildcards are either "*" (star) or "**" (double star). Single star will search a single depth for the next object, double star will search any depth.

 EG:
  @"Layer.Shape Group.Stroke 1.Color"
  Represents a specific color node on a specific stroke.

  @"**.Stroke 1.Color"
  Represents the color node for every "Stroke 1" in the animation scene.
